release 0.1.0

ADSEC: ADSorption Energy Calculation is a workflow used to compute the adsorption energies of relevant species and the energy barriers of transition states in catalysis, with the primary first-principles calculation software used in the current workflow being VASP.

v.0.1.0 Main Features 

* One can start from the bulk structure and calculate the adsorption energy of adsorbates on specified Miller index facets at specific sites based on input parameters. The adsorbates currently considered mainly include H/CO/CO2/COOH/HCOO/HCOOH.

* One  can calculate the transition state and the corresponding energy barrier between the specified initial and final structures.

ADSEC Bohrium App

For easier calculation of adsorption energies and transition states using ADSEC, a web-based Bohrium App is under development.
